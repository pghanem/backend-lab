# Backend Lab ðŸ§ª

A learning-focused backend project using **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, and **MySQL**.  
This project is for me to test and explore backend development concepts in a simplified environment, including:

- HTTP (REST & GraphQL)
- API versioning
- Authentication & security
- Multithreading & concurrency
- Database modeling & query optimization
- Logging & monitoring
